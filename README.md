the source code here is probably more up to date than the Source code in the release version.

# Text-converter
The Rerelease of Custom-Encoder

the Release and Beta Versions are there: https://github.com/Chaosminecraft/Text-converter/releases/

Update: i stop Beta updates until V2.9, i'm gonna make a Release version repo and a Beta version (more frequent updates but not sure if it runs) of it.

Please read the Licence if you modify the files or redistrobute it before editing it.
