This is the BETA branch of my project. If there have been some issues posted on the Main branch and I responded that there is a fix in the BETA branch, there is an updated version of the code then. (Testing on MacOS is impossible due to me not wanting to and also Apple being a douche of Prices)

So all said, this is the Branch that usually get's more updates. But also may not run occasionally on other platforms than Windows.
